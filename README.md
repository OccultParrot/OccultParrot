### About Me

I'm a software developer who loves figuring out how to make things! With 6 years of experience in software development and 1 year focusing on web technologies, I enjoy making cool projects and useful tools.

You can find more details about my professional experience and portfolio on my website: [stemler.dev](https://stemler.dev/)

### Current Projects

Here are a few projects I'm actively working on and excited about:

-   [**AnthraSheets**](https://github.com/OccultParrot/AnthraSheets): A website I wrote for the Anthrax path of titans server to simplify the logging of characters
-   [**Pixel Planet**](https://github.com/OccultParrot/pixel-planet): A procedural pixel art planet generator! Using shaders and Godot I am using a lot of fun math I dont usually have a reason to use.
