### About Me

Hello! I am a 7(ish) year hobby software developer! I typically write local software, but I have started getting into writting server code and webdevelopment!

My favorite language is **C#**, its just fun to write in and frameworks like MonoGame make it all the more fun to mess with! I have written the most in Python, but thats not all I can write in:

- Python
- C#
- Java
- Javascript (And Typescript lol)
- Lua (A little)
- C++ (A little)
- SQL
- Visual Basic
- GLSL (Shaders)
- Bash

### Current Projects

- Welp, all of them are private ones rn lol
