### About Me

I'm a software developer who loves figuring out how to make things! With 6 years of experience in software development and 1 year focusing on web technologies, I enjoy making cool projects and useful tools.

You can find more details about my professional experience and portfolio on my website: [stemler.dev](https://stemler.dev/)

### Current Projects

Here are a few projects I'm actively working on and excited about:

-   [**Pagget**](https://github.com/OccultParrot/Pagget): A custom Discord bot designed specifically for a Path of Titans community server. This project has been a fantastic opportunity to dive back into Discord bot development.
-   [**Parrots Photos**](https://github.com/OccultParrot/ParrotsPhotos): As a hobby nature photographer, I'm building this personal website to showcase my photography portfolio. It's a work in progress, but I'm enjoying the process of creating a dedicated space for my photos. Check out the development here: [parrotsphotos.com](https://parrotsphotos.com/).
-   [**soundboard.py**](https://github.com/OccultParrot/soundboard.py): A small, fun project developed as part of a friendly competition with a fellow developer to create a soundboard application using Python. It's nearly complete and has been a great learning experience!
